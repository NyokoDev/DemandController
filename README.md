# DemandController
Demand Controller mod for Cities Skylines: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2916710759

# Using a dev version on Windows
The AppData mod folder should be here (create it if you have to):

`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\DemandController`

To use this code:

0. Make sure you're unsubscribed from the workshop version
1. Clone the code
2. Build the project
3. Copy the output DLL to the AppData mod folder (the VS solution _should_ do this)
4. Run the game
